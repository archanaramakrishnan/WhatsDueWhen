# WhatsDueWhen
What’s Due When web application lets students see upcoming schoolwork for all their classes in one place and allows professors to add/edit their class schedules.<br>

## Idea
College students are constantly barraged by emails, announcements, and handouts from a wide variety of different sources. Keeping track of this deluge can be overwhelming. What’s Due When (WDW) aims to solve this problem by providing a central application that faculty and students can use to control the flow of information. Faculty can use WDW to add events (such as notes, due dates, or comments) directly to their students’ calendars on either a weekly, monthly, or semester basis. Students can use WDW to edit or add events to their own calendar with the extra benefit of having all events relevant to them gathered in one convenient place. The result will be a website where students and faculty can have schedules delivered in a manageable and convenient way.
